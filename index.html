          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            The <span class="bold">World Wide Web</span> is the sum of all <span class="italic">Web Pages</span>. These are documents written in <span class="bold">HTML</span> (<span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language</span>). They are connected and form a web thanks to <span class="bold">Hyperlinks</span>.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            All types of files can be found on the web such as plain text, videos, images, music, and more. <span class="bold">HTML</span> is made of text content, markup, references  to other documents and links to other pages.
           </p>
          </div>

         <div><h2 class="idea">Web browsers and HTTP</h2></div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	A <span class="bold">Web browser</span> allows to display those documents on a computer by making requests to the servers through the <span class="bold">Internet</span> (the world's largest network).
           </p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	These requests use the <span class="bold">HTTP</span> protocol to communicate with <span class="bold">servers</span>, which are bigger versions of a computer and host the files.
           </p>

         </div>

         <div><h2 class="idea">HTML Markup</h2>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	<span class="italic">Markup</span> is a text that is surrounded by an opening tag and a closing tag. A tag is contained in brackets. Some don't require a closing tab. These are called "void" tags. An <span class="italic">element</span> is everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
           </p>
          </div>
         </div>

         <div><h2 class="idea">Computers are stupid</h2>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            If a programmer doesn't write code carefully following the syntax, the computer might not understand his instructions.
            Computers are sensitive to typos and mistakes.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            That is why many problems could arise if a tag is not closed. For instance, everything will be italicised after an (<span class="italic">emphasis tag</span>) if it is not closed.
           </p>
          </div>
         </div>

         <div><h2 class="idea">Attributes, inlines and blocks</h2>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	An <span class="bold">attribute</span> is a property of an HTML element. A tag can have multiple attributes.
            For example, the anchor tag allows to link to <a href="https://www.reddit.com">another URL</a>.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            There are two sorts of tags: <span class="bold">inline</span> and <span class="bold">blocks</span>.
            <!-- For example, inline tags are <br> <b> <em> <img> <a> <span> <strong> and blocks <p> <div> or <form>-->
            The <span class="italic">Break tag</span> and the <span class="italic">Image tag</span> are <span class="bold">void tags</span> because they have no content. <!-- the image tag works like this: <img src="URL" alt="text"> an alternate text is needed if the image doesn't load ( broken requests)  -->
           </p>
         </div><h2 class="idea">Structure of HTML</h2>
         <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            <span class="italic">HTML</span> uses <span class="bold">indentations</span> to make a piece of code more coherent and structured.
           </p>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            <span class="italic">Indentation</span> represents a new idea. In HTML, it <span class="italic">increases</span> when an idea begins and <span class="italic">decreases</span> when this idea is finished.
            In order to succesfully display a Web page, it is also important to explain how a piece of programming code works for another person to quickly understand it.
           </p>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	Also, programmers can't remember everything. If they forget a detail they can look it up.

         	 <li>- CSS files are like the <span class="bold">style</span> of your house (colors, decoration, etc.)</li>
         	 <li>- Javascript files are like the <span class="bold">interactive</span> components (tv remote, garage-door opener, etc.)</li>

         <div><h2 class="idea">Tree-house structure</h2>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	The code of a Web page is a <span class="bold">Tree-like structure</span>. When programmers talk about the <span class="bold">DOM </span><span class="italic">(Document Object Model)</span> they are talking about this tree-like structure, which comes from the fact that the elements can have other elements inside of them. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	A web page is full of invisible boxes everywhere. Everything on a web page is actually a box but it is possible to change the shapes of the elements using styles.

          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
             It is important to avoid repetition to write good code!
    	     There are some benefits to this. It allows to save time, it helps to avoid mistakes and/or omissions. It is important to work more efficiently and to write more readable code.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	Commenting the code allows to communicate to others and helps you also to explain what you are doing. In CSS, code comments begin with <span class="bold">/*</span> and end with <span class="bold">*/</span>

         <div><h2 class="idea">Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
            In CSS, a <span class="bold">selector</span> defines the <span class="bold">elements</span> of the page that will be applied a <span class="bold">style</span>.
            You can add style to a tag throughout the page or to a class, you can also combine <span class="bold">selectors</span>. CSS is like a <span class="italic">search and replace</span> tool.
           </p>
          </div>
          <div>
         	<ul class="text-alignment" style="list-style-type: none">
         	<li>Where you define the rules and in what order they are applied matters in CSS.
         	The application of styles follows hierarchical rules. Styles are applied in the following order:</li>
         	<li>1. the default style of a browser</li>
         	<li>2. the stylesheet in a separate file</li>
         	<li>3. stylesheet inside HTML</li>
         	<li>4. inline style in an element</li>
         	</ul>
          </div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
          	Also, rules are applied to the elements they match and to their child elements (within those elements). If a child's element has multiple, overlapping rules that apply to it, the most specific rule always takes effect.
           </p>
          </div>
         </div>

         <div><h2 class="idea">Positionning boxes</h2>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	Setting the <span class="bold">box-sizing</span> property to <span class="bold">border-box</span>  makes the layout process easier (the size of the boxes can be set by a percentage instead of pixels).
           </p>
          </div>
          <div>
           <p class="text-alignment">
           	One of the most interesting CSS's functions is the <span class="bold">flex-box</span> attribute. It helps positioning the boxes next to each other, so that a programmer can use all the space on a webpage.
           </p>
          </div>

           	<li>To <span class="bold"><span class="italic">code, text, refine</span></span> is a pattern of coding. Follow these steps to upgrade the quality of your code:</li>
         	<li>1. Look for natural boxes (in the webpage)</li>
         	<li>2. Look for respected styles and similar elements</li>
         	<li>3. Write your HTML</li>
