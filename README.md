## Code Review

Your reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on:


* **Use of Syntax:**

    * All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass **HTML validation** and **CSS validation** tests.

* **Use of Logical HTML Structure:**

    * Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a **container element** (like a `<div>` or `<span>`).

    * Additionally, all tags should be used for their **semantic purpose** (ex: don't use a `<p>` tag to make a headline).

* **Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling:**

    * There shouldn't be any **unnecessary repetition** in your CSS code.

    * Similar HTML elements should have the **same class name**.

    * Class names are used in the CSS to **style related elements**.

    * Page uses **tags** appropriately (`<p>` for paragraphs, `<h1>` for first header, etc.)

* **Content Display:**

    * Page displays at least 1 **picture** and **some text**.

* **Important:**

    * You MUST include a CSS file in your project submissions. We want you to practice **linking CSS** in your HTML.

    * Simply using `<style>` tags is not sufficient enough to demonstrate your knowledge of linking CSS to your HTML file.
